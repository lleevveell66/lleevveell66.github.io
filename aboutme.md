I am level6 of LIE.  My turn-ons include (but are in no way limited to):
- A hot data closet on a cold Winter day
- A cold datacenter on a hot Summer day
- Red Team
- Blue Team
- Purple Team

I am a Purple Team master.  Some have called it "offensive security."  My hat is a hypnotic kaleidoscope of color.  I will do whatever it takes to free the impoverished information of the world. Information wants to be free!
